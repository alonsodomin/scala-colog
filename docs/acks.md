You gotta give credit where credit is due. `scala-colog` is a Scala fork of Dimitrii Kovanikov's [`colog`](https://github.com/kowainik/co-log),
the Haskell library that initially explored the idea of composable loggers. For more information about the internals
read [this very descriptive blog post](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2018-09-25-co-log) by its Author.
